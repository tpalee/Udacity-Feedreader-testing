# Udacity-Feedreader-testing

This is my submission of the Jasmine testing project which is part of the Udacity Frontend Development Nanodegree Program.

## Brief project-overview
In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. 
The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! 
Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. 
That's where you come in.

## How to get started
1. Download this repository and run index.html in your web-browser.
